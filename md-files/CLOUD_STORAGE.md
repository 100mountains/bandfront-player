# ☁️ BandFront Player Cloud Storage System

## Overview

The BandFront Player Cloud Storage system automatically uploads demo files to Google Drive to save server storage space and bandwidth. Instead of storing truncated demo files locally on your WordPress server, they're stored in the cloud and streamed directly to players.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Demo Upload**
- When a product has audio files and "demo files" is enabled
- BandFront creates demo versions (e.g., 30% of original length)
- Instead of storing demos locally, they're automatically uploaded to your Google Drive
- Original full files remain on your server for purchased customers

### 2. **Cloud Streaming**
- When visitors play demo tracks, they stream directly from Google Drive or other service
- No bandwidth usage on your server for demo playback
- Faster loading times (Google's CDN vs your server)
- Reduced server storage requirements

### 3. **Metadata Management**
- Cloud file URLs and metadata stored in database key 
- Automatic cleanup when products are deleted
- File versioning support for updated demos

## Current Architecture

### **Google Drive Integration**
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure connection to Google Drive API
- **API Key**: Required for reading files from players

#### **Key Components**

**BFP_CLOUD_DRIVE.clss.php** - The heart of the integration:
- Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Manages file uploads to Google Drive
- Creates and organizes folders
- Sets file permissions and sharing
- Provides download URL conversion
- Integrates with BandFront's hook system

**Google API PHP Client** - Official Google library:
- Provides standardized API access
- Handles authentication tokens
- HTTP request/response management
- Error handling and retries
- Service-specific wrappers (Drive, OAuth2)

**Third-party Dependencies**:

### **WordPress Integration**
- **Admin Interface**: ☁️ Cloud Storage section in BandFront settings
- **Hook System**: Integrates with existing audio processing pipeline
- **WooCommerce Meta**: Stores cloud file references per product
- **Addon Architecture**: Modular design for easy maintenance

### **File Management**
- **Automatic Upload**: Triggered when demos are created
- **URL Conversion**: Handles various Google Drive URL formats
- **Cleanup**: Removes cloud files when products are deleted
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to local files if cloud fails
