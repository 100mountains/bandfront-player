# PHP File Documentation Template for Bandfront Player

## Required Documentation Structure

### 1. File Name
- Full filename with extension
- Brief one-line description of the file's purpose

### 2. File Tree Location
```
src/
├── [ShowFileLocationHere]
└── ...
```

### 3. Human Description

  - Post meta queries (product-specific settings)
  - Option queries (global settings)
  - WooCommerce data access
  - Custom table queries (if any)
- **Write Operations**: What data does it save/update/delete?
  - Meta data updates
  - Option updates
  - File operations that affect database
- **Caching**: Does it use WordPress transients or other caching?

#### File System Operations
- **File Reading**: What files does it read from disk?
  - Audio files for processing
  - Configuration files
  - Template files
- **File Writing**: What files does it create/modify?
  - Demo file generation
  - Cache files
  - Upload directory operations
- **Directory Operations**: Does it create/manage directories?

#### REST API Usage
- **Endpoints Defined**: What REST endpoints does it register?
  - Route patterns
  - HTTP methods supported
  - Authentication requirements
- **Endpoints Consumed**: What external APIs does it call?
  - Third-party services
  - WordPress/WooCommerce REST API
- **Data Flow**: How does data move through the API?

#### Config System Integration
- **Settings Used**: What configuration values does it read?
  - Global-only settings (from `globalOnlySettings` array)
  - Overridable settings (from `overridableSettings` array)
  - Product-specific overrides
- **Settings Modified**: What configuration does it update?
- **State Management**: How does it interact with the Config class?
  - `getState()` calls
  - `getStates()` bulk operations
  - `updateState()` operations
- **Inheritance Logic**: Does it respect the product → global → default hierarchy?

#### Component Dependencies
- **Plugin Class Usage**: How does it access the main Plugin instance?
- **Component Access**: What other components does it use?
  - Player, Audio, Files, Analytics, etc.
  - Getter method usage (e.g., `getPlayer()`, `getAudioCore()`)
- **Hook Integration**: What WordPress actions/filters does it use?
- **WooCommerce Integration**: How does it interact with WC data/functions?

### 5. Code Quality Assessment

#### WordPress 2025 Best Practices
- **Security Issues**:
  - Input sanitization and validation
  - Output escaping
  - Nonce verification
  - Capability checks
- **Performance Concerns**:
  - Database query optimization
  - Caching implementation
  - File I/O efficiency
  - Memory usage
- **Modern PHP Standards**:
  - Type declarations usage
  - Error handling patterns
  - Code organization
- **WordPress Standards**:
  - Hook usage patterns
  - Data handling
  - Internationalization
  - Accessibility

#### Suggested Improvements
- **Security Enhancements**: Specific recommendations
- **Performance Optimizations**: Concrete suggestions
- **Code Modernization**: PHP 8+ features that could be adopted
- **WordPress Integration**: Better ways to use WP APIs
- **Architecture Improvements**: How it could better fit the plugin's architecture

### 6. Integration Notes

#### State Management
- How does this file work with the centralized Config system?
- Does it properly use bulk state fetching for performance?
- Are there any direct meta/option calls that should use Config instead?

#### Component Architecture
- How well does it follow the plugin's component separation?
- Are dependencies properly injected vs. globally accessed?
- Does it maintain proper abstraction boundaries?

#### Error Handling
- How does it handle failures gracefully?
- Are errors logged appropriately?
- Does it provide useful feedback to users/admins?

### 7. Testing Considerations
- What scenarios should be tested?
- Are there edge cases to consider?
- How can this component be tested in isolation?

## Example Usage

When documenting a file, follow this template exactly. Focus on:
1. **Accuracy**: Describe what the code actually does, not what you think it should do
2. **Context**: Explain how it fits in the broader plugin architecture
3. **Practicality**: Provide actionable improvement suggestions
4. **Completeness**: Cover all the technical aspects listed above

This documentation helps maintain code quality and assists with future development and debugging.
