check all files in this folder for references to css and js and the Views/ folder. update them if they do not point to assets/css/ or assets/js/ or templates/ (previously Views) in the plugin root folder.

DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER CODE OR CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE FILE

Key Points to Log:

dont change the file if css and js references are correct.
the filenames of the css, js and templates should not change.
do one file at a time then say BREAK and i will say CONTINUE.
