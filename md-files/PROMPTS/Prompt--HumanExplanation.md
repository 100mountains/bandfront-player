Now I can see the issue clearly. The DbRenderer class expects a Monitor instance to be passed in its constructor. Let me implement a proper solution by modifying the AdminRenderer to create the necessary instances for the templates.

Based on the code analysis, I'll implement option 3 that you mentioned. The AdminRenderer should instantiate the required dependencies (DbRenderer and Monitor) and make them available to the templates. Here's my implementation:

Perfect! Now I understand the complete flow. The Admin.php creates the AdminRenderer instance and passes it to Settings.php. The Settings.php then calls $this->renderer->renderSettingsPage() on line 81. 

The proper architecture should be:
1. Admin.php creates the AdminRenderer 
2. AdminRenderer needs to create Monitor and DbRenderer instances when needed
3. These instances should be passed to the templates

he flow now works correctly:

1. Admin.php → Settings.php → AdminRenderer.php → templates/global-admin-options.php
2. AdminRenderer creates Monitor and DbRenderer instances
3. global-admin-options.php includes dev-tools.php when dev mode is enabled
4. dev-tools.php accesses the $dbRenderer variable and calls renderDatabaseMonitorSection()
5. Settings are properly saved and the database monitoring checkbox state is persisted

Admin.php → Settings.php → AdminRenderer.php 
2. AdminRenderer creates Monitor and DbRenderer instances
3. Variables are injected into template scope
4. global-admin-options.php includes dev-tools.php
5. dev-tools.php confidently calls $dbRenderer->renderDatabaseMonitorSection()

•  ✅ Clear dependency injection: AdminRenderer creates and injects Monitor and DbRenderer instances
•  ✅ Clean template code: dev-tools.php simply uses $dbRenderer->renderDatabaseMonitorSection() with confidence
•  ✅ Single responsibility: Each class has a clear, focused purpose
•  ✅ No fallbacks needed: The architecture guarantees the dependencies are available
•  ✅ Self-documenting: The code clearly shows the modern approach with helpful comments

What we removed:
•  ❌ Backward compatibility code 
•  ❌ Global container fallbacks
•  ❌ Fragile error handling
•  ❌ Legacy pattern dependencies
