transferring player guts from old codebase

** OLD CODEBASE **

monolithic file

** what we like and want to have back **

- allowed selection of tracks on full playlist, selection of track hightlighted it, and pressing the track played it.

- widget rendering worked ! 




** NEW CODEBASE **

- any logic, icons, pngs has to be transferred into the new system laid out in AI-CODE-RULES
- new version supports mostly default css players
- may support pngs later
- has removed many over-rides and now uses state-manager.php
- split up concerns into class based system
